/**
 * Shared "masked secret" contract for settings forms.
 *
 * The backend redacts configured secrets (provider `api_key`, ntfy `token`,
 * Bark `device_key`, cluster SSH credentials, ...) to the literal
 * `****...****` in GET responses. Frontend editors must never prefill that
 * placeholder into an editable field — a paste that doesn't fully clear the
 * placeholder would produce `****...****sk-new…`, which used to be treated as
 * "keep the old secret" and silently discarded the new value (bamboo #430).
 *
 * `isMaskedSecret` is the client-side twin of Rust's `is_masked_api_key` in
 * bamboo/crates/infra/bamboo-config/src/patch.rs: a value counts as "masked"
 * only if it is non-empty and every character is `*` or `.` (an exact
 * structural match, not a substring check).
 *
 * Contract for any field using this predicate:
 * - On load: if the fetched value `isMaskedSecret`, start the input empty
 *   (never prefill the mask) and show a "configured, leave blank to keep"
 *   placeholder instead.
 * - On save: an empty input on an already-configured field means "keep the
 *   stored secret" — omit the field from the save payload entirely. A
 *   non-empty input is sent as the new plaintext value. The mask string
 *   itself must never be round-tripped back to the server.
